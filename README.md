Our desktop app uses AI, OpenCV, and machine learning to guide physiotherapy exercises. It leverages pose estimation and dynamic time warping for movement accuracy, provides feedback, and assigns performance scores. An AI avatar and voiceover enhance the user experience, all within an intuitive interface.
